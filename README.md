# HebrewVocab

This app is a personal project to assist me in the learning of Hebrew.
It has be designed in a way that will allow for reuse with other languages.

It primarily focuses on learning vocabulary. The user is presented with groups 
of words, each group containing six words. The user should memorize those words 
before moving on to the next set. Phrases are presented three at a time.
